## Solution

The solution has been easier than the organizers would think!

In this challenge we were able to upload PHP files and execute them. The description suggested using phpinfo() to retrieve information, so we did. The `readfile` function was blocked... but they forgot to block `file_get_contents`!

Once we figured it out, we scanned `/etc` with `scandir($dir)` and found a file named `f1@g.txt`. So we used `file_get_contents` to get its content and we got the flag: `darkCON{us1ng_3_y34r_0ld_bug_t0_byp4ss_d1s4ble_funct10n}`

### Extra

As the flag (and the description) suggested, if the functions to open the file were blocked, a bug to bypass the `disable_functions` could have been used. I didn't know about this bug, but this challenge gave me something to study.
