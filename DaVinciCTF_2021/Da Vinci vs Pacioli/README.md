## Description

'What an amazing game. Can you find my passwords?'

'Flag format: dvCTF{password}'

## Solution

In this challenge we are given a zip file called 'important_files'.
Once the content has been extracted, we are faced with another zip and a file with the .pgn (Portable Game Notation) extension, a format used to record chess games.
The 'chest.zip' file is password protected. First we look in the 'amazing_game.pgn' file and try to get some more information.

We know that is possible to encode and decode data in a chess game via chess steganography.
Using the following site: 'https://incoherency.co.uk/chess-steg' we can decode the moves of the game and get the string '3nfW@XuAT4LS4B5HmWBD&qMM5@RqVMgs' which turns out to be the zip archive password.

At this point we can extract the contents of the chest.zip file. We get two files: 'keys.kdbx' and 'nothing_to_see_here'.
To access the encrypted database we need a master password.

Even though the file is called "nothing to see here" we still tried to take a look. Also because the file has a large size.
The output of the command 'strings nothing_to_see_here' appears to return a repeating pattern.

'''

and so on.

To better analyze the content we redirect the output to a file with 'strings nothing_to_see_here > out.txt'
Let's try to find out if there is something different from the usual pattern.
By running 'sort -u out.txt > out2.txt' followed by 'cat out2.txt' we obtain:

'''
 !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~
737570345f647570345f70347373773072645f346d347a316e675f6e30315f77316c6c5f73757370336374

As we suspected!
By converting the hexadecimal string we get the database master password: 'sup4_dup4_p4ssw0rd_4m4z1ng_n01_w1ll_susp3ct'

Now we can access the database. Inside we found various accounts with their passwords. From the description of the challenge we know that a password must be entered between the flag format.
After few attemps we find the right one that corresponds to 'MQNFZ0VPGDsfeQCvudeX'.
We put in the flag format, sent it and BOOM!, we got the points.

# Flag

'dvCVTF{MQNFZ0VPGDsfeQCvudeX}'
