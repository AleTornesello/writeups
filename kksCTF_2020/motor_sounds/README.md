## Problem

## Writeup

If we open the [file](./file.gcode) that is given to us with any text editor we notice that inside it there are some writings that can be identified as GCODE, the following is an extract:

![gcode](./gcode.png)

Since the GCODE is used to encode the actions that are sent to a the 3D printer, let's try to open the file with a slicing program for 3D printers (Ultimaker Cura will be used in the following examples):
 
![cura1](./cura1.png)

We immediately notice that there are 3 writings, by rotating them in a position that allows us to read the central writing we will be able to see the flag:

![cura2](./cura2.png)

## Flag: 
```kks{W3_c@N_1n_3D!}```
