Oh, fish! My <u>`dinner`</u> has turned transparent again. What will I eat now that I can't eat that yummy, yummy, fish head, mmmmmm head of fish mm so good...

`Hint` : Is the image really empty?

## Analysis
In this challenge we're given a file called `fish.png`. If we open it we'll see that it's completly blank... but probably there's something hidden in it.

## Solution

Let's analyse the image with a steganographic tool such as Stegsolve. Just set `Colour Inversion (Xor)` and get the flag!
