## Solution

The challenge is the sequel of `Most Secure Calculator 1`. Now there's a regex and we can't use letters but only numbers and special chars. So we have to find another way to inject PHP code.
We can use XOR operator! Example: `'(' ^ '[' = 's'` infact the result will be:

Now we have to compose commands. The input has a length limit so we can't create commands char by char, we have to use longer strings... in order to do this we can use a tool called [XORpass](https://github.com/devploit/XORpass). It permits to convert normal text into XOR expressions. Let's prepare the payload, we will use the PHP function `file()` to open `flag.txt`. The result is an array of text lines so we have to access the first one by adding `[0]`:

```
file("flag.txt")[0] == ("[%*#"^"@}|:"^"}1:|")("4?1`~~.)"^"}}+|.3-#"^"/.{{~9{~")[0]
```
