        Hi Selina, 
        I learned about eval today and tomorrow I will learn about regex. I have build a calculator for your child.
        I have hidden some interesting things in flag.txt and I know you can read that file.
    -->
```


so we have to read the file flag.txt... Let's use the PHP `system()` function to execute os commands like `ls` and `cat`:
