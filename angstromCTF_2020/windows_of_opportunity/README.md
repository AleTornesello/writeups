# Windows of Opportunity
### Category: reverse
### Description:
Clam's a windows elitist and he just can't stand seeing all of these linux challenges! So, he decided to step in and create his [own rev challenge](windows_of_opportunity.exe) with the "superior" operating system.
### Author: aplet123
### Solution:
Just throw up the executable into notepad and search for actf{ because the superior operating system doesn't have `strings`
